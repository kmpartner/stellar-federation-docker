```

or the following one if you have set up ssh keys on GitHub:

```
git clone git@github.com:bloqhouse/stellar-docker.git
```

## Configuration

This repository requires you to create a `.env` file in the project root directory in order to pass all the required environment variables:

```
# .env

# LETSENCRYPT STAGING ENV
# CHANGE IT TO true FOR DEVELOPMENT
LETSENCRYPT_STAGING=false

POPULATE_ACCOUNTS_TABLE=INSERT INTO accounts (first_name, last_name, friendly_id) VALUES ('name', 'surname', 'nickname') ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

# SECRETS

## Usage

After having created the `.env` file you can build the containers running the following command:

```
docker-compose build
```

You can also omit to explicitly build the containers in a separate step and proceed to build and deploy with one command using:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

If you have set up correctly all the environment variables you should be able to access via HTTPS a fully working Stellar federation.
